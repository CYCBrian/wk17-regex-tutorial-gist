# Understanding Regex: By a Beginner, For Beginners

Are you diving into the world of web development like I am? If so, you've probably stumbled upon this thing called regex, or regular expression. Your first thought might be a confused '...Huh?...What?' Honestly, mood.

In this tutorial, I'll guide you through the rage-inducing world of regex, breaking down its components into simple, digestible chunks. I'll also throw in a bonus because I'm so generous: deciphering a regex used for matching emails. 

Let's get started!

## Summary

A regex, or regular expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It's used mainly for pattern matching within strings or large bodies of text. It allows you to specify conditions or patterns that are then used to find, extract, or manipulate text you've targeted.

For this specific tutorial, we'll be deciphering a regex that is used to validate whether a string of text is a email or not:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

Before we start though, it's important to understand the common components used in creating a regex.
